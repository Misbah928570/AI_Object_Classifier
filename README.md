## 🤖 YOLOv8 AI Agent Detection System
This project is a Streamlit-based object detection system powered by YOLOv8, enhanced with an AI Agent that performs deep analysis of detections and provides a feedback loop for low-confidence predictions.
Developed as part of a 5th semester mini-project.

## 🚀 Features
🔍 Real-time or image-based object detection
🧠 AI-powered expert analysis using structured JSON responses
🔄 Automatic feedback loop for improving low-confidence detection results
🎙️ Voice feedback using text-to-speech
📊 Interactive visualizations (confidence graphs, summary tables, frequency analysis)
💾 Downloadable full detection summary reports
🎨 A beautifully designed UI using advanced custom CSS

## 📦 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Packages you need include:
```
streamlit
ultralytics
opencv-python
numpy
pillow
pyttsx3
plotly
pandas
requests
```
3️⃣ Download YOLOv8 model weights

Weights load automatically (yolov8n.pt, yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt).
But you can also download manually from Ultralytics.

4️⃣ Run the app
```
streamlit run app.py
```
```
